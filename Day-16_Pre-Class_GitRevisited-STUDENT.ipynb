You need to be able to push to the repo so you and Jacob can build off of one another’s work, but working in this way is causing significant difficulties for Mika and Navi. Working on an entirely new repo isn’t an option, either, since both teams want to keep track of their past commits.* \n",

    "Branches are a powerful and important tool when using git.  However, some folks are never exposed to this extra functionalty, thus missing out on their utility and power! Once you understand how they work you will likely find ways to use them all the time (sort of like git itself). \n",
    "\n",
    "Branches are a great location for doing new work in your git repositories. Branches are a safe place to store changes to files without fear of running into issues with work that others might be doing on the same repository.  Anytime you want to change files, it is good to get into the habit of making sure you are making and committing those changes to a branch.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To create a branch just type the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "    git branch BRANCHNAME\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a new branch, you can list all of your branches (including the default \"main\" branch) and see which one you are on using the following command:\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "    git branch\n",
    "    # Notice the lack of a BRANCHNAME here!\n",

    "1. Make a new repo called `day16-pre-class-repo`. Clone this repo into your `CMSE202/repositories` folder (you should have created this space as part of the Day 3 content from a while back).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In your `day16-pre-class-repo` folder, make sure there are no outstanding changes haven't been committed and pushed to your repository. Double-check this with `git status`. There shouldn't be any changes since you just created this repository, but if there are for some reason, commit them, and push them to your GitHub repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a new branch called `testing`:\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use `git branch` command to confirm that you now have this new branch in your list of all branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. \"Checkout\" (switch to) this new branch using the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` bash\n",
    "    git checkout testing\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Confirm that you are now on this new branch using `git status`. At the top of the status message, it should tell you which branch you are on.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Once you're in your new `testing` branch, create a new python script called `hello_world.py` that contains a simple [\"Hello, world!\" program](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/examples/hello-world). Once you've finished your script save and close it. **You should be able to do this using `vim`, but it might have been a while since you've used this.** Feel free to create this \"`.py`\" file using whatever method you prefer.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `commit` your new `hello_world.py` script to your testing branch and then try running `git log` to see that you've made a new commit to your new branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If it looks like everything is good, now you're going to try switching back to your main branch to see what happens when you do. Running the following command:\n",

    "    ``` bash\n",
    "    git checkout main\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. At this point, you should find that the `hello_world.py` file you created is gone(!) -- what happened? Because that file is part of your other branch, it no longer exists when you're working inside the \"main\" branch. Convince yourself that git is still safely keeping track of your file by switching back to your `testing` branch with:\n",
